**Hiring Committee**
**Eviction Defense Collaborative**
San Francisco, CA

## Dear Members of the Board and Search Committee,

I am writing to express my compelling interest in the Executive Director position at the Eviction Defense Collaborative. As a researcher whose career has been dedicated to understanding eviction prevention at the highest level—advising the White House, HUD, and Treasury on national eviction policy—I recognize that EDC represents the gold standard of what evidence-based eviction prevention actually looks like in practice. I am ready to transition from informing policy to leading the organization that proves the model works.

**The Opportunity Before EDC**

San Francisco's Right to Counsel program is a national exemplar. The data is undeniable: 93% of clients with full-scope legal representation remain housed. That translates to approximately 4,650 families per year who do not lose their homes because of EDC's work. The cost-benefit analysis is equally compelling: San Francisco invests $6,300 per eviction case prevented and saves $66 million in downstream homelessness costs. This is not aspirational policy—this is proven, replicable, scalable intervention.

Yet EDC operates at a critical juncture. As a mission-driven legal services organization, you face the structural challenges endemic to the nonprofit sector: constrained funding, infrastructure stretched thin, and the constant tension between immediate service delivery and long-term sustainability. The search for a new Executive Director reflects not crisis, but clarity: you need leadership that can simultaneously stabilize internal operations, diversify revenue in a fiscally constrained environment, and amplify EDC's voice as a national leader in tenant advocacy.

**What Leadership Must Accomplish**

As a leader stepping into this role, I understand the work ahead has three interconnected dimensions:

**Internal Stabilization & Infrastructure**: Legal services organizations succeed when back-office operations—finance, HR, data systems—allow the lawyers and advocates in the field to do their best work. My experience managing complex research budgets across federal funders (NIH, HUD, Veterans Affairs) has taught me fiscal rigor, compliance excellence, and resource allocation under constraint. I will bring these same operational competencies to EDC's finance and HR functions, ensuring that systems support—not hinder—staff effectiveness.

**Strategic Revenue Diversification**: Federal and foundation grants have historically supported legal services, but that landscape is shifting. EDC needs a leader who can articulate its value to diverse funding sources: individual major donors who believe in housing justice; corporate foundations aligned with racial equity and economic mobility; government contracts that reflect the proven ROI of Right to Counsel; earned revenue partnerships with other legal services organizations and nonprofits. I have demonstrated success securing $4.6M in competitive grants across multiple federal agencies. More importantly, I have built sustained relationships with program officers, foundation leaders, and government officials. That network—combined with genuine commitment to learning individual donor development and nonprofit revenue strategy—positions EDC to think creatively about financial sustainability.

**Leadership with Authentic Voice**: The board has correctly identified that you need a leader who can speak with authority about housing justice, whose presence in policy conversations carries weight, and whose passion for this work is unmistakable. I have spent 15 years building that credibility. I have testified before state legislatures on eviction trends. I have briefed city councils and mayoral administrations on housing policy. I have advised federal agencies during national crises. Critically, this experience has taught me something essential: policy influence is only meaningful if it translates to impact for real people. EDC represents that translation. Your lawyers prevent evictions. Your financial assistance prevents homelessness. Your advocacy shapes the legal and political environment to protect tenants. This is the work that actually changes lives.

**Why I Am Ready to Lead EDC**

I could have continued as a policy advisor, a research director at a prestigious university, or a consultant to federal agencies. But intellectual satisfaction pales against the urgency of housing instability in this country—and particularly the racial disparities that my own research has documented. Black women in some metropolitan areas face eviction rates seven times higher than white women. Eviction is not distributed equally; it is a crisis concentrated on communities of color and lowest-income households. EDC's work directly addresses this inequity.

I am also drawn to this role because I recognize a paradox in my own career: my research has informed city policies about Right to Counsel programs, yet I have never led a Right to Counsel program. I have written about eviction prevention, but I have not prevented the evictions themselves. I have analyzed data on what works, but I have not built the infrastructure that makes it work. EDC offers the opportunity to close that gap—to move from studying effective interventions to leading them.

The transition from researcher to executive leader is intentional, not accidental. The skills transfer. Strategic vision, coalition building, team development, fiscal stewardship, stakeholder engagement, and data-driven decision-making are equally critical to leading a research network and leading a legal services organization. The difference is that at EDC, decisions have immediate, tangible impact: a family stays housed, a tenant avoids homelessness, a community is strengthened.

**My Immediate Priorities**

**First 90 Days:**

1. **Deep listening and assessment**: Meet with all staff, board members, and key community partners. Understand current operations, existing strengths, and specific challenges in HR, finance, and governance.

2. **Staff and culture stabilization**: Establish transparent communication, visible leadership presence, and quick-win initiatives that demonstrate commitment to the people who do this work daily.

3. **Infrastructure audit**: Conduct comprehensive review of finance, HR, and data systems. Identify gaps and bring in specialized expertise where needed (controller, HR manager) to strengthen lean functions.

**Months 3-6:**

4. **Revenue strategy**: Develop 18-month revenue diversification plan with board development committee. Map current funding sources, identify gaps, and establish pipeline for foundation grants, major gifts, government contracts, and mission-related revenue.

5. **Strategic clarity and voice**: Position EDC nationally as the model for Right to Counsel programs. Develop media strategy, speaking engagements, and policy influence opportunities that raise EDC's profile as a leader in tenant advocacy.

6. **Board alignment and governance**: Clarify decision-making structures, board committee responsibilities, and staff-board relationships to ensure effective partnership.

**Looking Forward**

I envision EDC as not just San Francisco's leading tenant advocacy organization, but a national model that other cities explicitly replicate. I see a financially sustainable organization with diversified revenue streams that reflect the true value of your work. I see staff who feel supported by excellent infrastructure and clear about their mission impact. I see a board and leadership team aligned around strategy and empowered to execute it.

This vision is achievable. The model works—your 93% success rate proves it. What is required now is leadership that can operationalize excellence, secure the resources needed to sustain and scale it, and amplify EDC's voice in policy conversations that shape housing justice nationally.

I bring to this role 15 years of demonstrated expertise in housing justice, proven success in securing resources and building teams, and authentic commitment to the communities EDC serves. I also bring intellectual humility: I know what I am expert in (eviction prevention research, policy strategy, coalition building), and I am committed to learning what I must (individual donor development, nonprofit finance and governance, legal services operations). The best leaders grow in role, and I am ready to grow into the particular challenges and opportunities that EDC presents.

Thank you for considering my application. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to EDC's mission of protecting low-income tenants from eviction and homelessness.

Respectfully,

**Tim Thomas, Ph.D.**
